=head1 NAME

Persist::Tabular - Abstract base class for Persist::Table and Persist::Join

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Persist::Tabular> and L<Persist::Join> for a synopsis of the
functionality provided by Persist::Tabular.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides functionality common to Persist::Table and Persist::Join.
Specifically, the iterator functionality.

=over

=cut

# =item $tabular = new Persist::Tabular($driver)
#
# Creates a new object using the given driver.
#
sub new {
	my ($class, $driver) = @_;

	my $self = bless {}, ref $class || $class;
	$self->{-driver} = $driver;

	$self;
}

# =item $self-E<gt>_open($reset)
#
# Tells the driver to open the appropriate object.
#
sub _open {
	die "Must be implemented by subclass.";
}

# =item $self-E<gt>_sync($reset)
#
# Saves any changes made since the last C<_sync>.
#
sub _sync {
	my ($self, $reset) = @_;
	$self->_open($reset);
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>first

Moves the iterator position to the first row of the data set. This method
should be used to reset the data position to the beginning.  Either this
method or C<next> must be called before data is accessed.  If there are
changes pending in the current row, then those changes are saved before moving
the iterator position.

This method should be avoided when possible as it may entail a greater
performance cost associated with resetting cursors and such in the underlying
driver.

=cut

sub first {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(;bytable)], @_);

	$self->_sync;
	$self->{-data} = $self->{-driver}->first(
		-handle  => $self->{-handle},
		-bytable => $args{bytable});
	$self->{-data} ? $self : undef;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>next( [ $bytable ] )

Moves the iterator position to the next row of the data set. Either this
method or C<first> must be called before data is accessed. This is the
preferred method as it doesn't result in restarting calls which may involve
resetting cursors, etc. in the driver's store. If there are changes pending in
the current row, then those changes are saved before moving the iterator
position.

If the C<$bytable> option is set to true and this is a join, then this will
not return a hash of all column-names pointing to values. Instead, this will
return an array of hashes. Each element of the array will be the data
corresponding to the respective table defined in during the call to C<join>.

=cut

sub next {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(;bytable)], @_);

	$self->_sync;
	$self->{-data} = $self->{-driver}->next(
		-handle  => $self->{-handle}, 
		-bytable => $args{bytable});
	$self->{-data} ? $self : undef;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>filter($filter)

Changes the filter or filters used to filter the data set and resets the
driver handle. Either C<first> or C<next> must be called to access the data
after this call is made.

For information on the format of filters see L<Persist::Filter>.

=cut

sub filter {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(filter)], @_);

	$self->{-filter} = $args{filter};
	$self->_sync(1);
	$self;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>order(\@order)

Sets or changes the order columns are to be sorted and resets the driver handle.
Either C<first> or C<next> must be called to access the data after this call is
made.

=cut

sub order {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(order)], @_);

	$self->{-order} = $args{order};
	$self->_sync(1);
	$self;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>offset($offset)

Sets or changes the offset that the table uses and resets the driver handle.
Either C<first> or C<next> must be called to access the data after this call is
made.

=cut

sub offset {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(offset)], @_);

	$self->{-offset} = $args{offset};
	$self->_sync(1);
	$self;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>limit($limit)

Sets or changes the limit that the table uses and resets the driver handle.
Either C<first> or C<next> must be called to access the data after this call is
made.

=cut

sub limit {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(limit)], @_);

	$self->{-limit} = $args{limit};
	$self->_sync(1);
	$self;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>options([ $filter, \@order, $offset, $limit ])

This allows a number of options on the table to be set at once and then resets
the driver handle. Either C<first> or C<next> must be called to access the data
after this call is made.

=cut

sub options {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(;filter order offset limit)], @_);

	# Use exists to make sure we undef when they want us to!
	$self->{-filter} = $args{filter} if exists $args{filter};
	$self->{-order}  = $args{order}  if exists $args{order};
	$self->{-offset} = $args{offset} if exists $args{offset};
	$self->{-limit}  = $args{limit}  if exists $args{limit};
	$self->_sync(1);
	$self;
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>value($column)

Reads the data found in the given column. Either C<first> or C<next> must have
been called prior to the this.

=cut

sub value {
	my ($self, %args) = parameters('self', [qw(column)], @_);
	my $key = $args{column};

    return $self->{-data}{$key};
}

=item $tabular-E<gt>I<E<lt>columnE<gt>>

Shortcut for of C<value> that reads the data found in the given column.

=cut

sub AUTOLOAD {
	my ($self) = @_;

	my ($key) = $AUTOLOAD =~ /::([^:]+)$/;
	$self->value($key);
}

sub DESTROY {
 	# prevent AUTOLOAD from hooking
}
