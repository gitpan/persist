   be sorted correctly--specifically dates in the BC epoch.
3. [./Persist/Driver/DBI/DBI.pm] Throughout this code all tables and field

   always be sorted correctly--specifically dates in the BC epoch.
6. [./blib/lib/Persist/Driver/Memory.pm] In closures generated to
   filter/join tables, we need to add define tests or set 'no warnings' to
   turn off 'xxx used with undefined' warnings.
